// install the nodeJs
node -v
    conlole.log("test string")

// create first app from https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

npx create-react-app my-app
    Success! Created my-app at /Users/mihail_orlov/Documents/repos/my-app
    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    npm start
        Starts the development server.

    npm run build
        Bundles the app into static files for production.

    npm test
        Starts the test runner.

    npm run eject
        Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
        and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

cd my-app
npm start

    Happy hacking!
