# Installation Guide

To set up the necessary environment for our geostatistical analysis, we need to install two key Python libraries: `scikit-learn` and `pykrige`. These libraries will enable us to perform various machine learning tasks and geostatistical kriging, respectively. Follow the steps below to install them using Conda.

## Steps:

1. **Install scikit-learn:**
   This library is essential for machine learning and data processing tasks.
   ```bash
   conda install scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Install pykrige:**
   PyKrige is a kriging toolkit for geostatistical analysis. It's available through the conda-forge channel.
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pykrige
   ```

After successfully executing these commands, you'll have the necessary tools to proceed with geostatistical computations and analyses.

This Markdown text provides a clear and concise guide for installing `scikit-learn` and `pykrige` using Conda, including a brief description of each library's purpose.

## Updating Conda:

It's recommended to keep your Conda installation up to date. However, please note that the attempt to update Conda in this instance did not succeed.

To try updating Conda, use the following command:
```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```
